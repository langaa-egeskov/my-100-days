Resources
- from his blog: Books, Learning vi and Vim; Hacking Vim

from the video
ctrl+z = push program to background
fg = pull it back

vim -O file1 file2 
opens files in vertical panes

rewatch to get mappings he uses for vimrc
he uses a lot of mappings

Bash
alias pvenv = ‘virtualenv -p /path/to/anaconda/python venv’
but dont make it an alias until you learn it

alias ae = ‘source venv/bin/activate’
